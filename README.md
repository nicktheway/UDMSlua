## Unity Dance and Motion Scripter (lua version)

UDMSlua (Unity Dance and Motion Scripter in Lua) is a Unity engine application for designing and visualizing
human movement in 3D with the help of Lua scripts. 

The scenaria programming interface of UDMSlua was designed to give the user maximum
design freedom by providing access through Lua scripts to

1. most of the Unity Engine’s native scripting API,
2. new methods that simplify the creation of dance scenaria.

It also facilitates Lua scripting by supporting the use of many different scripts for each scenario and supports some advanced runtime functionality, such as running code snippets or executing commands on selected domains of a scenario. The scripting API is also extensible by supporting user defined libraries.

It uses the xlua framework for connecting the C# and Lua domains.

The UDMSlua distribution contains Lua scripts which implement several categories of dance
models that (hopefully) produce interesting and aesthetically pleasing results. Some of the
included model categories are: epidemic, game theoretic and logical dances.

## Unity version
UDMSlua has been created and tested with Unity2019.4.10f1 on Windows (7, 8 and 10). 

The application can, also, be built and run on linux (x86_64) and MacOS. However, it hasn’t been tested
on those platforms.
