Here are instructions on how I entered the Mixamo Anims to the project.

1. In Mixamo.com I select a character.
2. In Mixamo.com I select various anims and download them. They must be downloaded in the format (e.g.) "ybot@Armada.fbx". I.e., we get the name of the avatar and then the name of the anum. 
2.1 So I have the avatar on which these anims are "scaffolded". 
2.2 This is important to get the anium names alreay in the anim clip properties.
2.3 It is also important in setting up the anim clip, as will be seen in the sequel. 
3. I move the avatars and anims into the Project Assets/Moves/Subdir 
4. Setup the  avatars: in Unity editor select the *.fbx file and in Rig setting
4.1 Animation Type: Humanoid
4.2 Avatar Definition: Create from this model.
4.3 Apply
5. Setup the  aniclips: in Unity editor select the *.fbx file and 
5.1 in Rig setting:
5.1.1 Animation Type: Humanoid
5.1.2 Avatar Definition: Copy from other avatar and select as source the "associated avatar" (from steps 1 and 2) 
5.1.3 Apply
5.2 in Animation setting:
5.2.1 Set on Loop Time
5.2.2 Set on Root Transform Rotation: Bake into Pose
5.2.3 Set on Root Transform Posiiton Y: Bake into Pose
5.2.4 For script reference, the name of the Aniclip is the one appearing UNDER "clips / start /end"
5.2.5 You may want to vary the clip start, end frames
5.2.6 Apply
6. Drag Aniclip into appropriate Ani Controller.
6.2 I have arranged them in columns, each column corresponds to a subdirectory of the Moves directory
